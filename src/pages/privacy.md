# Privacy Policy

We have **_temporarily_** enabled client-side analytics via [Plausible](https://plausible.io).

Plausible is an Open Source solution that does not use cookies. The server is self-hosted by a maintainer of SVGOâ€”located in the United Kingdom ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

If you're interested in what we see, please review [our Plausible dashboard](https://plausible.falco.fun/svgo.dev). We are keeping the dashboard public for transparency.

If you use an ad blocker such as [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com), you will be unaffectedâ€”we don't hide the fact we use Plausible, and these kinds of extensions will block analytics servers by default. If you are uncomfortable with analytics, we recommend installing uBlock Origin, which will block most client-side analytics across the web.

<h2>Data Collection</h2>

No personal data is collected, no cookies are stored, we don't sell or share data, no data is monetized, etc.

Data collected includes referral sources, top pages, visit duration, information from the devices (device type, operating system, country and browser) used during the visit. Read more in the [Plausible Analytics data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).
